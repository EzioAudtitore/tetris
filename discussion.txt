How to run the game (using Visual Studio): 

(1) Clone/download the repository in your device.
(2) Open game.cpp in Visual Studio (game.cpp has the main() function in our project).
  You could also find and open main.cpp; it has only one line #include "Game.cpp"
(3) Run game.cpp. The game should work properly.

How to run the game (without using Visual Studio):

You will have to use CMake to build the project.
Or on the terminal manually link, compile, and run the project (-o, -c).
